# SQL-INJECTION
SQL Injection (SQLi) Demonstration Project  This repository contains two PHP scripts that illustrate SQL Injection vulnerabilities and how they can be fixed. It is designed as an educational resource for students and developers learning about web security.

# SQL Injection (SQLi) Demonstration Project

This repository showcases how SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities occur in web applications, and how to prevent them using secure coding practices in PHP.

## Project Overview

This project contains two PHP login scripts:

- **login_demo.php**: Demonstrates a basic login system with intentional SQLi vulnerability.
- **login_demo_secure.php**: Secure version using prepared statements and input validation to prevent SQLi.

## How To Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Place the scripts and `/images` folder on your local PHP server (like XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP).
3. Access `login_demo.php` in your browser to see how SQLi attacks can bypass insecure code.
4. Use `login_demo_secure.php` to see how input validation and prepared statements fix these issues.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the risk and mechanics of SQL Injection.
- Compare insecure and secure coding practices in PHP.
- Practice improving authentication security.

## Technologies Used

- PHP
- MySQL

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. Do not use insecure code in any live, production environment.
